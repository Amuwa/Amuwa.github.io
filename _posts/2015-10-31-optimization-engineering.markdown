For extremely complicated optimization problems, mathematical methods usually fail in finding the exact optima. Smart researchers resort to approximations, which are sometimes based on experience or intuition, and often unexplainable in rigorously mathematical ways. However, they may perform pretty well in practice.

To find, or to develop, approximations for extremely complicated optimization problems, we can not rely only on known mathematics, which provides us specific points of view. What if there is any point of view, or notion, that is unknown by far which actually would lead us to brand new mathematics?

If we compare the known mathematics as the Geocentrism (Geocentric Model), they do provide some descriptions and clues about planets, but in an extremely complicated way. However, when it comes to Heliocentrism, the orbiting of planets seems to be much simpler.

We probably are able to state that complication may be a lack of appropriate model. An engineering way is to try different possible patterns, adjust parameters, and then experiments and revise the model. However, the resulted model may be unable to be totally explained mathematically. So, it might be the mathematics' fault, isn't it?
