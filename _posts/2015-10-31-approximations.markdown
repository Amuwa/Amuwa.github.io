For the scheduling in production, the NP-hardness of the problems demands efficient and effective approximations. However, approximations for general problem settings may perform worse than specially designed ones for the specific settings. But as the reconfiguration of production flows becomes more and more frequent in response to varying and fluctuating market demands, and the production environment itself is actually dynamic in nature as well, the new settings also need to re-configure even to re-design, frequently.
